# Ripples-composition

An interactive music software system written by Andrew R. Brown

Ripples is a musical duet where the human performance stimulates a cascade of responses from the software which listens and analyses the musician’s performance and responds in realtime with generated output. This work tries to achieve  an elegant balance of between the  musician and computer. The generated materials combines chordal and arpeggiated material derived from underlying patterns of oscillation, with adaptation and constraints based on realtime analysis of the musician’s harmonic, dynamic, and density patterns.

Ripples software is availible for two environments, Extempore and Pure Data.
