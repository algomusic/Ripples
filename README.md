# Ripples-composition

An interactive music software system written by Andrew R. Brown

Ripples is a musical duet where the human performance stimulates a cascade of responses from the software which listens and analyses the musician’s performance and responds in realtime with generated output. This work tries to achieve an elegant balance between the musician and computer. The generated materials combine chordal and arpeggiated material derived from underlying patterns of oscillation, with adaptation and constraints based on realtime analysis of the musician’s harmonic, dynamic, and density patterns.

Ripples software is availible for two environments, Extempore and Pure Data.

Here are some examples of previous performances:
